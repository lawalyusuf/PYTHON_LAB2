#Trig Functions
#Trigonometric functions are used to calculate sine and cosine in equations. By default, Python does not know how to calculate sine and cosine, but it can once the proper library has been imported. Units are in radians.

# Import the math library
# This line is done only once, and at the very top
# of the program.
from math import *

 
# Calculate x using sine and cosine
x = sin(0) + cos(0)
print(x)
