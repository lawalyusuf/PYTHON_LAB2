#While Loop

'''
 key point of the while loop is that the loop might not ever run.
 When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop
 body will be skipped and the first statement after the while
 loop will be executed

count = 0
while (count < 9):
   print 'The count is:', count
   count = count + 1

print "Good bye!"
