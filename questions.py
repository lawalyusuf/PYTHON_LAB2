Question:

a) ## This programs asks a user for a name and a password.
# It then checks them to make sure the user is allowed in.

1. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number
is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

1b. Python Program to Check Prime Number

2.  Letâ€™s say I want to make a piece of code that converts from a numerical
grade (1-100) to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F)

3. In this program, you'll learn to find the largest among three numbers using
if else and display it.

4. Python program to check if a number is positive, negative or zero
